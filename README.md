# About This Project

This repository is intended for people who want to start a GUI test automation, using the Ruby + Capybara + Cucumber tech stack.

The intention is to help beginners to practice test automation, without worrying about the initial setup of the environment, getting straight to the point!

This project uses the website [The Internet](http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/), where you can improve your automation skills through various web elements available for handler.
